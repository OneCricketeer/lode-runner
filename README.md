Lode Runner
===

Lode Runner in native Java Swing. Written for a [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://rose-hulman.edu/) course final project. 

> _DISCLAIMER_: Code was originally written with only ~1.5 years of Java knowledge, so most patterns are very poorly implemented in order to get working within a few weeks two people and other assignments.
> 
> Code was later refactored (@OneCricketeer) to make more portable + readable and slightly more testable.
